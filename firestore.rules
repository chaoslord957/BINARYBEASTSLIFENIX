/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Medical Vault application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for medical documents. Each user has exclusive access to their own documents stored under their respective user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All medical documents are nested under the /users/{userId}/medicalDocuments/{documentId} path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own medical documents.
 * - Listing of all medical documents across all users is disallowed.
 * - The 'userId' field within each document must match the 'userId' in the path for create operations.
 * - The 'userId' field cannot be changed after document creation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'userId' field is denormalized within the MedicalDocument entity to enable fast, simple ownership checks within the rules, avoiding costly `get()` calls. This makes rules more efficient and secure.

     * @deny (get, update, delete) - User 'user_xyz' cannot get, update, or delete a medical document under /users/user_abc/medicalDocuments/doc1.
     * @principle Enforces strict document ownership based on the 'userId' field and path-based authorization.
